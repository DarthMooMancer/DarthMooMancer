# Hello there, I'm DarthMooMancer!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a love for coding and problem-solving. Here's a little bit about me:

## ðŸŒŸ About Me
I am a softmore in highschool who wants to study in software development, make a game engine (maybe), and go insane when I see java. I use neovim for development (it't just objectively better than anything else), I use tmux, and know a few languages (Python - mainly pygame, Java - Thanks APCS, and learning C/C++ everyday). I use Arch linux btw (Desktop) and Macos (Laptop). I have used Arch for 5 years or so now (as of 5/14/2025). 

- **Want to learn**: Docker and Rust (That will be some time, I don't think I will leave C++ for some time)
- **Current Focus**: Learning **C/C++** with making things like snake in the terminal (eventually it will be a public repo).
- **Always**: Looking for and to help with projects (hint.hint my polydev project)

## Featured Projects

Here are some of the most impactful projects I've worked on:

1. **[Polydev](https://github.com/DarthMooMancer/Polydev)**  
   A Neovim plugin designed for project management, supporting multiple languages and evolving based on user feedback.

2. **[env](https://github.com/DarthMooMancer/env)**  
   My current dotfiles folder for both Macos and Linux (main branch is old just macos and env is both).

3. **[Dwm-Dots](https://github.com/DarthMooMancer/Dwm-Dots)**  
   A curated repository for **dwm** dotfiles, optimized for simplicity, speed, and efficiency.

4. **[i3-Dots](https://github.com/DarthMooMancer/i3-Dots)**  
   Stable and fast configurations for the i3 window manager, tailored for productivity, it is the simplest and most organized of my dotfiles.

5. **[Hypr-Dots](https://github.com/DarthMooMancer/Hypr-Dots)**  
   A Wayland configuration repository with a focus on **Hyprland**, showcasing advanced features.
