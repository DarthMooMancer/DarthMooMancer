# Hello there, I'm DarthMooMancer!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a love for coding and problem-solving. Here's a little bit about me:

## ðŸŒŸ About Me
I am a softmore in highschool who wants to study in software development, make a game engine (maybe), and go insane when I see java. I use neovim for development (it't just objectively better than anything else), I use tmux, and know a few languages (Python - mainly pygame, Java - Thanks APCS, and learning C/C++ everyday) 

- ðŸ”­ I have a couple of repos for dotfiles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new technologies and improving my skills.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with collaborative projects and innovative ideas.
