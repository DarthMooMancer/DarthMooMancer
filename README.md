## ðŸ’» Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects:

- [Hypr-Dots](https://github.com/DarthMooMancer/Hypr-Dots.git): It's called Hypr-Dots, but its more or less a wayland repo that is no longer maintained.
- [i3-Dots](https://github.com/DarthMooMancer/i3-Dots.git): Mostly i3-wm dots that is stable and fast.
- [Project 3](https://github.com/DarthMooMancer/project3): A dwm repo for dotfiles that is the most up to date and is the simplest and fastest of the 3 listed. The dots for dwm can be used on pretty much any system, but mainly targeted towards Arch.
